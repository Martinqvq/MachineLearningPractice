## Result

Paper - [Using Crowd-Source Based Features from Social Media and Conventional Features to Predict the Movies Popularity](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/smartcity/2015/1893/00/1893a273-abs.html)

Drop the row with missing values
Measure the accuracy of the test subset (20% of instances) => Same as paper
Takes "Genre, Gross, Budget, Screens, Sequel, Ratings" as Conventional Features
and Drop Gross Income as it is not available before release
and Ratings is the one to be predicted.
